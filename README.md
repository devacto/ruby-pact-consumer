## Pact Test

[Pact](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) defines a pact between service 
consumers and providers, enabling "consumer driven contract" testing.

I merely followed [this](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) tutorial.

A really good example of how Pact is used can be found 
[here](https://github.com/uglyog/example_pact).

IMPORTANT - Remember the following:

1. "Person Service" is the provider.
2. "Payroll Service" is the consumer.
