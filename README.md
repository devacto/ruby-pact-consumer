## Pact Test - Consumer

[Pact](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) defines a pact between service consumers and providers, enabling "consumer driven contract" testing.

This is the consumer project. I merely followed [this](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) tutorial.

A really good example of how Pact is used can be found [here](https://github.com/uglyog/example_pact).
